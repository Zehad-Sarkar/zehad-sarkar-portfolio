        Hello everyone, my name is Zehad Sarkar, and I'm a web developer. I
        pursued a diploma in mechanical engineering from Shamoly Ideal
        Polytechnic Institute between 2013 and 2017. After completing my
        diploma, I gained valuable experience by working in the garments
        industry from May 2018 to October 2022.
        <br />
        In August 2022, I made a decision to follow my passion for programming
        and transitioned into the field of web development. I took the leap and
        resigned from my previous industry in October. From there, I embarked on
        a journey of self-improvement, starting with learning HTML and CSS. I
        enrolled in an online learning platform and dedicated myself to
        mastering various web development technologies.
        <br />
        During the period from December 2022 to June 2023, I honed my skills in
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, Firebase, and
        MongoDB. It has been an exciting and rewarding experience to explore
        these technologies and see how they come together to create amazing web
        applications.
        <br />
        As a fresher in the web development industry, I am eager to apply my
        knowledge and skills in a professional setting. My goal is to join a
        software services company where I can contribute my passion for web
        development and continue to grow both personally and professionally. I
        am committed to expanding my knowledge and staying up to date with the
        latest industry trends.
        <br />I look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals and
        exploring opportunities to contribute to meaningful projects. Thank you
        for taking the time to learn a bit about me, and I am excited about the
        possibilities that lie ahead in my web development career.
